## About

I am a master student majoring in Computer Science at Northeastern University, Silicon Valley campus. I graduated with my BS degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin in 2016. After that I was working as an (onsite) Quality Analyst at Apple. My interest is in software engineering and I am familiar with database design, big data applications, and iOS developing. I would describe myself as a self-motivated fast learner with strong teamwork spirit.

Phoebe is not her real name. Her official name is Xingrong, i.e. 'stella-lotus' in Chinese, which has no meanings at all. A fortune-teller said it would bring her good luck (which is not true). She named herself Phoebe at the age of 17 since she was a huge fan of FRIENDS and Phoebe was her favorite female character. But now she likes Monica more. Too late to change the name though.
